# Cracking the Code Interview JS


This project is to resolve all or most of the problems if possible with Javascript from the book "Craking the Code interview".
For testing I am using Jest.


**Note:** It will be my own solutions, so don't expect to be perfect and 
surely there will be a better way to solve the problem.



This is still under progress


Thanks for checking!
